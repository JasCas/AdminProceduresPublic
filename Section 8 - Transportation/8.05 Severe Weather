Background

Schools in the Living Sky School Division No. 202 are expected to remain open and operational on all designated days of the school year. However, in order to ensure the health and safety of students and school division personnel during periods of severe weather conditions, plant breakdown, or interrupted services, a decision may be made to suspend the operation of school buses and/or schools.

Procedures

1.	Responsibility of the Director of Education
a)	The Director of Education or designate is authorized to dismiss students, discontinue transportation services, and close schools as emergencies arise.  

b)	Adverse winter driving conditions may be valid reasons for the non-operation of school buses.

2.	Early Morning Decisions
a)	Environment Canada North Battleford, Scott, and Spiritwood temperatures are to be used as a guide for all schools. Buses are not to run if the combined temperature/wind chill factors result in a reading of -40 degrees Celsius or below at 6 a.m. Buses that do not run at the regular time in the morning due to a -40 degrees Celsius combined temperature/wind chill conditions are not to run at all on that same day.

If the buses are cancelled for the day, the Transportation Manager or designate will update the Bus Cancellations page on the Division website after 6 a.m.

b)	If buses do not operate due to a -40 degrees Celsius combined temperature/wind chill (as per (a) above), educational tours or extracurricular travel by bus scheduled for later in the day will also be cancelled. Educational tours or extra-curricular travel by private vehicle will also be cancelled.  If educational tours or extracurricular travel has been cancelled, but the temperature is -35 degrees Celsius or warmer combined temperature/wind chill two (2) hours before the time of departure, transportation may be allowed with approval of the Director of Education or designate.
 
c)	In addition to (a) and (b) above, there will be times where a bus driver will determine that transportation of students on their route will be unsafe. For example, in addition to severe drifting, icy roads, fog, and blowing snow in winter, drivers may also encounter deteriorating road conditions in spring due to melting and prolonged rainy weather. Bus drivers should consult with families along their route to determine if roads are safe to travel and use their individual discretion when deciding whether or not to travel down certain roads, provide yard service, or choose an alternate route/road to travel on.

d)	Buses are not to operate if weather conditions such as freezing rain, dense fog, heavy rain, or severe dust storms impair visibility or otherwise cause dangerous travel conditions.

e)	The good judgement of bus drivers in their decisions regarding safety is to be supported.

f)	Bus drivers are to decide whether or not to run by no later than thirty (30) minutes before the first scheduled morning pick-up, and by no later than one (1) hour prior to the scheduled afternoon dismissal.

g)	If a decision is made not to operate (except as in (a) and (b) above) a rural bus route, the bus driver is to immediately inform the school Principal and the Transportation Manager. The bus driver will also inform all families in the route about the decision not to run. If the bus does not run due to mechanical problems, the route will only be cancelled for the morning or afternoon run. Consultation with a service technician is required for determining if a repair or other bus will allow for the route to be run.

h)	Notwithstanding (f) above, if the Transportation Manager or designate makes a decision not to operate bussing in the Town of Battleford or the City of North Battleford, the Transportation Manager will inform school principals immediately.

i)	Schools will remain open for staff and students despite inclement weather and will only be closed, with the Director or designate’s authorization, in the event of a threat to health and/or safety. If buses are not operating and parents/guardians drive their children to school, it is the responsibility of the parent to arrange for their child/children’s transportation home at dismissal time.

j)	If extreme weather conditions develop when bus operators are returning students from school to their homes, the bus operator shall ensure that each student is delivered to his/her home and enters the house.  If circumstances make it impossible to deliver the student to his/her home, the bus operator shall keep the student in the vehicle and, in consultation with the principal, make appropriate arrangements for the safety and well-being of the student.

k)	Parents/guardians are responsible to ensure all students riding on buses during winter months shall wear winter footwear and outerwear and to carry with them winter headwear and gloves or mitts.  In those cases, where children are not appropriately attired for winter conditions, the bus operator shall advise the principal who may restrict access until appropriate conditions are met.

l)	Unless there is a safety hazard within the school, once students have arrived at school they are not to be sent home from school earlier than the regular dismissal time. Should weather conditions make it impossible for buses to return students to their homes at the end of the school day, students shall go to the billets that have been established for them at the beginning of each school year. The following billeting procedures shall be followed:
	After consulting with the Transportation Manager or designate, the bus operator shall contact the Principal of the schools concerned that the buses will not be running because of weather conditions.

	The Principal of each school shall ensure that students who travel on school buses arrange for billets to be available in extreme weather conditions. A list of students and their billets shall be compiled and retained by the Principal.
		
	Bus operators shall notify parents that buses are not running and that arrangements are being made at the school to inform billets. Parents are advised to contact billets to ensure that the billeting arrangements for their children have been made.

	The Principal shall ensure that each billet is notified before a student leaves the school building.  The Principal shall determine if the weather conditions are conducive to students safely reaching their billets and by what mode (e.g. walking, bus, pick-up by billet, etc.). Students should not be dispatched from school until a safe arrival at their respective billets can be assured.

	If the Principal deems it necessary and/or practical, any school buses that are available shall assist in the delivery of students to their billets (e.g. elementary students).
