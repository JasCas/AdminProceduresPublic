Background

As per The Education Act, 1995, it is the duty of the Board, subject to the Regulations, to furnish transportation services to students to and from school that may be considered by the Board to be necessary to insure access of students to, and regular attendance in, the schools of the school division.

The Board accepts this duty and affirms that the safe transportation of students and other passengers is of the highest priority, as stated in Procedure 8.02 Student Transportation Safety.

The Board believes in the establishment of clearly defined bus transportation services by designated attendance areas, as per Procedure 8.07 School Attendance Area.

Transportation Within Attendance Areas

The establishment, alteration, or cancellation of bus routes shall be determined by the Transportation Manager after consulting with the Chief Financial Officer.

Students living within an urban attendance area may be eligible for transportation where a natural or man-made barrier on the route is determined to be hazardous to student safety.

Kindergarten to grade 8 students residing in Battleford or North Battleford will be eligible for free transportation if they reside beyond 1.0 kilometer from the school within their attendance area as measured in a straight line from their home to the school.

Grade 9 to 12 students residing in North Battleford will be eligible for transportation subject to a fee set by Living Sky School Division, if they reside beyond 1.0 kilometer from school as measured in a straight line from their home to the school.

School Attendance areas shall be determined, reviewed, and possibly altered according to Procedure 8.07 School Attendance Area.

The Transportation Manager may authorize alternate pick up or drop off locations. Any changes will continue to the end of the current school year. Any changes will be reviewed annually in the spring by the Transportation Manager.
 
Students who wish to have an alternate pick up or drop off location may be accommodated as courtesy riders under the following conditions:
	Space is available on the bus;
	There is no significant diversion from the approved route;
	There is no significant added cost to the school division;
	Student safety is not compromised, and
	There is no impediment to local traffic.

Transportation out of Attendance Areas and/or Division Boundaries

The Board of Education prefers that students attend the school in their attendance area.  Transportation of students out of attendance areas will be the responsibility of the family unless programming needs can not be met at the school within the students’ attendance area or extenuating circumstances make it necessary to transport students to another school. 

Procedures

1.	a)  Requests for bus transportation outside the school attendance area within the school division 
     boundaries

	The bus operator should adhere to the schedule as near as possible.
	Bus routes will be designed so students will have to spend the least amount of time in transit as is reasonably possible.
	If students are late in reaching their pick-up point, the bus operator shall wait no longer than two minutes unless the students are in sight.
	The schedule shall be arranged so that the bus arrives at school not more than fifteen minutes before class begins.

	The bus shall be in position for loading passengers at school ten minutes before school is dismissed.
	Buses shall not leave for a minimum of ten minutes after the school dismissal bell unless all students are accounted for.  Buses are expected to wait for students who are later than ten minutes provided that an acceptable reason for such a delay has been communicated to the bus operator.  Undue pressure shall not be brought to bear on students to rush from their classrooms in order to catch the bus.
	Buses are to leave the school drop-off/pick-up point in the order they are parked.  An operator waiting on a student may pull ahead if safe to do so allowing adequate distance between buses.
	Buses shall follow the prescribed route until all passengers have disembarked.
	The bus operator shall pick up only those passengers who attend the school to which he/she drives, except in cases of emergency.  Extension to or changes in the route shall not be made without the knowledge of the Transportation Manager or designate.
	The bus operator, in consultation with the Transportation Manager, shall determine the exact pick-up and drop-off points on the bus routes, exercising due regard for safety and distance which students must walk.
	Routes will be designed to eliminate as many turn around points as possible and to maximize the carrying capacity of each bus.  No bus will be overloaded.  
	Pick up and drop off points will be located at convenient and safe locations.  The following factors should be considered:
o	The need for students to cross highway or major road to load or unload should be avoided.
o	Steep hills, sharp curves or switchbacks, narrow bridges, railway crossings, or any other hazardous situation that could affect the safety of the bus or students should be avoided.
o	Turning around should be avoided; if required, the Transportation Manager is to ensure that the parent/landowner provides turn around areas that are adequate in size and are properly maintained.
o	Locating a bus stop on an active oil access road or industrial site should be avoided.
	The length of the route shall be calculated as follows:
o	Kilometers from school to first pick up plus kilometers from first pick up to school x 2 = Daily Kilometers
o	Additional kilometers for kindergarten are to be noted in addition to the regular kilometers.
o	This information is to be completed on the Bus Route Kilometer form and submitted along with the route/map information within one week of the beginning of school.
	All students on rural routes may receive yard pick-up providing the following conditions are met:
o	The access road to the yard is maintained (graveled, snow removed).
o	Adequate and unrestricted space is available to turn the bus around within the yard.
o	The Division prefers that buses do not back up; but if the bus has to back up, the back up area must be large enough to accommodate the bus.
o	The area to be travelled by the bus within the yard is to be kept clear of all objects (vehicles, equipment, snow).
	It is the responsibility of the residence to ensure the safety of animals, children, and property in yard areas used by buses.
	A bus operator may be transferred from one route to another, by the Transportation Manager in consultation with the Superintendent of Human Resources, where such a transfer is necessary for safety, efficiency, or good order.  

Transportation of Students With Special Needs

	Before a decision is made to provide bus service to a student with special needs, an assessment shall be made by the Superintendent of Student Services or designate of the student’s ability to ride the bus.
	The parents/guardians and bus operator shall be made aware of their respective responsibilities.
	The bus operator shall be informed of any special medical or physical needs of the student.
	The student shall be properly supervised (if necessary) so the bus operator can concentrate on driving safely. Consultations may be arranged with school-based personnel, the bus operator, and Transportation Manager or designate to determine the best solution possible to ensure the safety of the student and others on the bus. 

 
	In the case of a lift being used in a bus, the following will apply:
o	The parent shall provide any assistance the student requires outside the bus either for loading or unloading.
o	The bus operator will assist the student to the door of his/her residence.

Guest Bus Passengers

	The following procedure shall apply regarding requests for “guest” passengers:
o	Parents/Guardians shall request approval from the regular route bus operator at least two days in advance of the trip.
o	The bus operator will confirm with parents/guardians making the request if space is available on the bus.

Training

	The Transportation Manager and/or designate shall provide orientation and in-service for school bus operators to ensure safe operation of the school division transportation system.
	Contractors shall provide appropriate training and orientation for their employees.
	Handbooks shall be provided by the Transportation Manager in respect to the following:
o	Bus Operator Responsibilities
o	School Bus Safety and Maintenance
o	Student Conduct

Substitute Bus Operators

	Substitute bus operators are employed on a day-to-day basis as required to replace a bus operator who is temporarily absent from his or her duties and are subject to the same procedures and regulation as regular bus operators.
	Regular bus operators may use, as a substitute bus operator, only those persons who are approved by the Board as bus operators.
	Substitute bus operator Claim for Payment Forms shall be submitted to the School Secretary of the school for which the substitute bus operator has driven.

School Staff Bus Drivers

	School staff may be employed as regular bus operators if approved by the Transportation Manager or designate.  They may however act as temporary or substitute bus operators for a regular bus route.
	The use of a school staff member as a bus operator for school sponsored travel such as educational tours, excursions and athletic travel should only be the case when the principal has made reasonable effort to procure another bus operator approved by the School Division.  Situations such as necessary early departure or departure at dismissal time rather than having to wait for a regular bus operator to be available would be the cause to have a school staff member drive the bus.
	Where the school staff driver is also the coach or supervisor, there will be no payment for the lay over time, but rather only for driving time plus one half hour for servicing of the bus.
	Where the school staff driver is not the coach or where he or she is not required to supervise and other situations as outlined above, then it would be reasonable to have a teacher as a driver and be paid accordingly for the driving, layover time and bus servicing.  In this situation, it is assumed that such time is beyond the normal instructional day.






Regular Student Transportation vs Extra Curricular Transportation

	As per Transportation Procedure 8.06: Special Use of Buses/Private Vehicles, regular student transportation will take priority over extra-curricular travel. The regular bus to be used for its regular route, rather than be used for an extra-curricular trip. As well, the regular driver is expected to drive his/her route, rather than drive for an extra-curricular event. Any variation from this must have the approval of the Transportation Manager or designate.
