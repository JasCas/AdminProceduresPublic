Background

•	The safe transportation of school vehicle passengers in a school vehicle must remain top priority.  In order to ensure this, there must be co-operation between bus operators, students, their parents/guardians and the schools. 

•	The three principles which govern school bus/vehicle safety are:
1.	Safety
2.	Order
3.	Respect 
Procedures

1.	Bus operators are responsible for the physical and emotional safety of the children who ride their bus/vehicle, as well as for their own safety.  The child must be confident that the bus/vehicle is a safe place.

2.	The bus operator has an obligation to maintain order and control.  This control is compromised if passengers interfere with the service of the bus/vehicle, or are causing physical damage to the bus or distracting the bus operator.

3.	Everyone on the school bus or in the vehicle, bus operators and passengers, must respect the rights of others.  Behaviour which compromises this respect should not be tolerated.

•	Any problem that occurs on the school bus or within a vehicle is often the result of violation of the Student Conduct Guidelines.
•	The most valuable tools available to all bus operators are good judgment and common sense.
•	Acceptable behaviour must be identified, and the consequences of unacceptable behaviour must be clearly stated so as to be understood by all.
•	While the Division provides transportation, it does not relieve parents from the responsibility of supervision prior to the child boarding the bus/vehicle in the morning or after the child leaves the bus/vehicle at the end of the day.
•	Principals or designates are responsible for the supervision of loading and unloading buses.
•	The principal is to advise and support a bus operator in the discipline of students on a school bus.
•	Students are responsible for their conduct to the bus operator and to the principal of the attending school.
•	Bus emergency evacuation practices shall be organized by bus operators in conjunction with the school principal and conducted at least twice a year.
