Background

To meet the credit requirements for graduation, students employed under the supervision of a journeyperson, in a trade in which the hours worked are eligible for apprenticeship credit, may earn up to four Secondary Level Apprenticeship credits on the basis of work proposed and completed by the student.  The Apprenticeship credits shall be named Apprenticeship A20, B20, A30, and B30 and may be used to fulfill the requirements for graduation.  

Granting of credit for approved apprenticeships recognizes student achievement in trades outside of the regular Secondary Level program.  Only students who are registered in a secondary school in Saskatchewan and are working (employed) in a trade are eligible for Apprenticeship credits.  

The apprenticeship need not be related to a specific school subject. Apprenticeship credits may be used to meet the Practical and Applied Arts/Arts Education credit requirement or as electives to meet the 24 credit requirements at the Secondary Level.
