Background

Living Sky School Division recognizes that all children benefit from positive early childhood experiences. Vulnerable children in particular benefit from Pre-Kindergarten programs that facilitate the development of the whole child through an integrated, holistic approach. The key components of a Pre-Kindergarten program are a responsive learning program, a caring environment, family involvement, community partnerships and integrated services.


Procedures

1.	Children who are three and four years old may be eligible to attend Pre-Kindergarten where the program is offered by the Division.

2.	Although an attempt will be made to balance the number of three and four year old children in the program, whenever possible children with the greatest need will be provided with the opportunity to attend the program for two years.

3.	In order to ensure that the children with the greatest need are served, student selection criteria will be utilized. If necessary, a prioritized waiting list will be compiled. Student selection will include, but is not limited to, the following:
a.	Children who live in the area served by the Pre-Kindergarten program;
b.	Referrals from the regional health authority or the Department of Community Resources;
c.	Social-economic factors;
d.	Indications of vulnerability;
e.	Displays by the child of developmental, social,  behavioural, emotional or communication delays;
f.	English as a second language for the child;
g.	Other factors in consultation with the Early Learning Consultant.

4.	Family involvement is vital to an effective Pre-Kindergarten program. Pre-Kindergarten staff will actively encourage the engagement of parent and family members in the development and education of their children. In an ongoing process to support parents, staff will provide opportunities for parents to enhance their parenting and life skills.
