Background

Living Sky School Division believes that a sense of heritage and identity, combined with an understanding of democratic values and processes are important to the development of students as contributing members of Canada.


Guidelines

Living Sky School Division believes it is important to foster the growth of its students such that they are able to take their place as secure and productive members of Canadian society. In order to do this, students need the assistance of school division personnel in the following ways:

1.	Teach students the knowledge, skills and understanding to play an effective role in society at local, national, and international levels.

2.	Help students to become informed, thoughtful and responsible citizens who are aware of their duties and rights and who demonstrate honesty, integrity, compassion and fairness.

3.	Promote in students spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, making them more self-confident and responsible both in and beyond the classroom.

4.	Encourage students to play a helpful part in the life of their schools, neighbourhoods, communities and the world.

5.	Teach students about the Canadian economy and democratic institutions and values; encourage respect for different national, religious and ethnic identities; and develop students’ ability to reflect on issues and take part in discussions while respecting differences in opinion.

6.	Ensure that all students have a working knowledge of their rights and responsibilities under Treaty Six, and have some familiarity with First Nations and Métis ways of knowing.

Procedures
