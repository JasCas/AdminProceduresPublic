Background
Living Sky School Division recognizes that some students within the Division are able to demonstrate a high level of achievement of the learning objectives of particular course without spending the required hours enrolled in the course.  The Ministry of Education allows students to challenge a maximum of two provincially-developed courses at the 10 or 20 level for credit, and to demonstrate the course requirements through a rigorous and comprehensive challenge process in order to move on to further learning.  Using the Course Challenge Process, a student may obtain two course challenge credits.
