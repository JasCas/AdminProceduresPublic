Background

Physical activity contributes to the physical, academic and social well-being of each student, and is an integral part of the educational program.  Living Sky School Division is committed to ensuring a safe environment for all students and staff.  All physical activity programs must be founded on teaching and supervision practices that are safe and sound - ensuring that the goals for physical, mental and social development are appropriate at every grade level.  The Division believes that students’ lives and learning are enhanced when they participate in a variety of physical activities.


Standard of Care: While no physical activity can be made entirely risk free, the Division’s standard of care is that exercised by a careful parent of a large family.
