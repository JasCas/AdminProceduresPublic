Background

Living Sky School Division recognizes its responsibilities regarding the education of students with intensive needs.  Special programs and services designed to meet the needs and speak to the strengths and abilities of these students will be approved and implemented by the Director of Education. The Division believes students should be in an environment that helps stimulate all of their physical, social and intellectual development, and as such supports the process of inclusion for students with intensive needs.

Schools will be inclusive in nature, and will honour diversity.

Inclusion reflects the belief that all children belong to and are valued members of the school community.

Diversity recognizes that differences, including those of environment, culture, heritage, language, abilities and needs are to be expected, respected and planned for.

When the concepts of inclusion and diversity are merged each student with intensive needs becomes the focus of a relevant, personalized educational program. The focus is on the child as a learner and the development of appropriate programs and supports tailored to the individual differences and needs of the student.

Intensive Needs supports include:

•	Professional services from speech and language pathologists, psychologists, occupational therapists, social workers, etc.;
•	Extra help from student support teachers;
•	Medical or community-based services/referrals; and
•	Assistive technologies such as computer software or hardware. 

Procedure
1.	The Director of Education is responsible for the implementation, maintenance and supervision of programs and services for students with intensive needs.

2.	The Director has the authority to designate supervisory duties to the Superintendent of Student Services, Principals, Student Services Teachers and other professional staff.
