Background

In accordance with Saskatchewan Ministry of Education Policy, Living Sky School Division authorizes the availability in every high school of three special project credits per student for out-of-school initiatives.  Such credit is to be obtained in accordance with the regulations of this procedure.

Procedures

•	The proposed project must be seen as a unique learning experience for the student.  Student activities that would be considered as a normal part of extra-curricular or co-curricular activities generally offered by a school may not be granted “Special Project Credit” recognition (eg: school team sports, school newspaper, yearbook etc.).  Programs may include areas of study such as community service, in-depth research in academic training, technology, the performing arts, athletics and entrepreneurship. 
•	Access to this credit will be for students who have completed Grade Nine.
•	Prior to the development of a Special Project Initial Plan a student must consult with the principal or designate.
•	The student must submit a Special Project Initial Plan to the principal or designate, and receive approval from the principal or designate prior to the project start date.


1.	The Special Project Initial Plan Requirements

a.	There is an expectation that the initial plan include considerable detail.
b.	The initial plan must include a description that would identify specific outcomes.
c.	The initial plan must show how the plan contributes to the personal growth and development of the student.  Previous experience in the proposed area of study, if any, shall be identified.
d.	The initial plan should list a proposed outline of experience and processes to be followed, including expected completion date.    A minimum of 100 hours must be devoted to the project.
e.	In accordance with Saskatchewan Ministry of Education Policy, this credit supersedes the policy of awarding credits for external programs, as of September, 1997.
f.	Projects may not be based primarily on mere participation in an activity, event, club or the like.  However, participation could be included as part of a project, provided that such participation accounts of no more than half the project.
g.	The principal, in consultation with the student, will identify and secure a teacher mentor who will oversee the project.
h.	The Final Project Plan must include signed approval by the student, student’s parent or guardian, teacher and project mentors, and the high school principal.  The principal is required to submit the Final Project Plan to the Director of Education or designate.  The school division shall retain a copy of each special project proposal on file for a minimum of two years.
i.	When a project takes a student off-campus, the provisions of the Work Experience Education Guidelines for coordinating and monitoring shall apply, as appropriate.

2.	Monitoring the Project
a.	The project mentor(s) will take primary responsibility for monitoring the project.  The school principal and teacher mentor will take overall responsibility for monitoring the progress of the project.
b.	Parents are responsible for all transportation of any child in an approved Special Project that involves experiences away from the school site.

3.	Evaluating and Reporting
a.	The project mentor shares responsibility for the assessment and evaluation of the student’s learning.  An external evaluator may be invited to be part of the evaluation process.  The criteria used to evaluate the project will be as outlined and accepted in the Special Project Initial Plan.
b.	Each student completing the “Special Project Credit” shall present for final evaluation evidence of personal growth in the project’s stated outcomes.  This could be presented in many forms.  Some examples include an attestation by the project mentor, a portfolio, a reflective journal, a videotape, etc.

4.	Appeal Process
a.	In the event of a dispute arising from this policy or its application, that dispute shall be resolved according to the school division’s dispute resolution policy or procedures.
