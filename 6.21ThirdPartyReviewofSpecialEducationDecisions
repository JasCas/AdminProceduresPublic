Background

In keeping with Section 186 of The Education Act, 1995, Living Sky School Division has set a review process to follow when a disagreement over a pupil’s designation, placement and/or program is in question.

Procedure

1. 	Initial Action 	  
Option 1
The school division will first attempt to make every effort to resolve a designation, placement and/or program decision in a manner amicable to the pupil, parent(s)/guardian and school division.
		
Option 2
The pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian should contact the person who made the decision respecting a pupil’s designation, placement or program.  If that person is unknown, the pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian should contact the principal for assistance in determining who made the decision.  Every effort will be made to resolve concerns at this level.
a.	If there is no resolution, the pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian(s) will request the involvement of the principal of the school.

b.	If there is no resolution, the pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian(s) will request the involvement of the Superintendent of Student Services.

c.	If there is no resolution, the pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian will request the involvement of the Director of Education.

2.	 Initiating a Review
a.	When the initial action does not resolve the disagreement, the pupil or his/her parent(s) /guardian will have access to the Division’s process for the resolution of such disagreement.

b.	The pupil with a disability or his/her parent(s)/guardian(s) will initiate the process by a request in writing to the Director of Education.  In their request, individuals will set out the reasons for the disagreement with the decision.
 

c.	Within five (5) school days of receiving the request for a review of a decision, the Director of Education will respond in writing to the individual requesting the review, outlining:
i.	the steps in the review process
ii.	the procedure used to establish the neutral third party
iii.	the expenses the Board will cover
iv.	suggested timelines of the review

3.  	Selecting a Neutral Third Party
a.	A review of the disagreement will be conducted by a person(s) not involved in the initial decision(s).

b.	Within ten (10) school days of receiving the request for a review of a decision, the Director will arrange a date for a meeting with the individual requesting the review to determine the neutral third party.

Option 1
The neutral third party will be a person acceptable to both parties.

Option 2
The neutral third party will be made up of the following members:
a.	one person chosen by the pupil or his/her parent(s) or guardian
b.	one person chosen by the Director of Education
c.	one person acceptable to both parties

To select a neutral third party person(s), the following process will be used:

a.	The Director will nominate three persons to the pupil/parent(s)/guardian(s).  The pupil/parent(s)/guardian(s) will review the listing and determine if one of the persons from the Director’s listing is a suitable choice as a third party representative.
b.	If none of the three persons selected by the Director are acceptable to the pupil/parent(s)/guardian(s), the pupil/parent(s)/guardian(s) will suggest three different candidates to the Director.  The Director will review the suggested list and determine if a selection can be made.
c.	In the event that no agreement can be reached, the review process will be discontinued.
d.	In the event that there is no agreement, the Board of Education will be presented with the names and will make the final decision on the neutral third party.


4.	Completing the Review
 Within thirty (30) school days, the third party will meet to conduct the review and to complete a report.

a.	Conducting the Review
i.	The third party will receive submissions from both the pupil /parent(s)/guardian(s) and the school officials.  These submissions may be supplemented by representations from other parties called to the process by either the pupil/parent(s)/guardian or the school officials.
ii.	As part of the procedure, the third party conducting the review may call upon any person who has participated in the educational planning/decision-making process to clarify the issues that surround the review.  The third party may also call upon outside experts in the field being reviewed.
b.	Submitting a Report:
i.	The third party will submit a report to the Director of Education and to the individual(s) requesting the review.  The report will include an analysis of the situation under review and make appropriate recommendations.
c.	Director of Education Decision
