Background 
The Supervision and Evaluation Procedure is supportive in its promotion of continuous growth, collegial learning and goal-based professional development. The intent of supervision is to provide a positive, considerate supervision process and a fair, objective performance evaluation. Supervision is a dynamic and on-going professional process for the teacher.
This procedure and associated processes are designed to balance the professional learning of teachers with the corporate accountability of Living Sky School Division. To facilitate this balance, it includes both formative and summative processes designed to encourage professional development, highlight and build upon effective teaching practices and provide informal and formal direction.
1.	General Introduction 
a)	The supervision processes are designed to promote professional learning and to provide corporate accountability in accordance with The Education Act, 1995 Section 109 (2) and Section 175 (1) and (2).
b)	The ultimate goal of teacher supervision is to continually improve the professional competence of teachers so that student learning is maximized through high quality instruction. Professional growth is most effective if it results from internalized, self-identified and/or cooperatively identified needs, in concert with specific strategies to meet those needs. Any process of supervision, growth, appraisal and review is a change-oriented process designed for the improvement of instruction and the development of individuals with the goal of keeping staff and students interested, growing and motivated. It is set within the context of improving student achievement. 
c)	Teacher supervision is a process of planned and collegial practices at both school and division levels that are designed to support quality education and help teachers grow professionally. 
d)	These practices address all areas of core curriculum (planning, instruction and assessment), the learning environment (including relationships with students, staff and parents), classroom management, and professionalism. 
e)	It is understood that teachers, as professionals, have expert knowledge based on academic training and experience. It is also expected that over the course of a teacher’s career, he or she will journey     
from the novice to the expert to distinguished professional teacher. Professional learning processes are intended to support teachers as they progress along this continuum of growth and competence.

f)	Written documentation provides insight into the growth, performance and competence of teachers, as well as evidence of all stages of their professional learning activities. Documentation may take the form of walk-through checklists, professional learning plans, reports, reflections of the teacher and supervisor, and artifacts that reveal the varied dimensions of a teacher’s professional life.
2.	Statement of Beliefs 
a)	Living Sky School Division’s Supervision and Evaluation Procedure reflects an approach to improve student outcomes and is based on the following beliefs:
i)	Each teacher will strive to become an expert professional educator. 
ii)	The process of teacher supervision is developed through both formative and summative strategies and methods. 
iii)	Teachers engage in ongoing and repeating cycles of self-reflection, renewal and growth throughout their careers. 
iv)	Teachers begin with training and continue to acquire training and experience throughout their careers. 
v)	Professional learning is initiated by teachers and is facilitated by system support and collegial collaboration.
vi)	The process of teacher supervision acknowledges the need and provides for accountability. 
vii)	Due process allows for the fair and equitable treatment of all involved in the process. 

3.	Definitions 
a)	Formative Supervision is a developmental process based on mutually set goals. It encourages both self-assessment and professional learning.
b)	Summative Supervision is a process that focuses on assessing professional learning and competencies and is conducted with the full knowledge of the teacher. The two outcomes of summative supervision are the continued development of professional knowledge, attitudes, skills, application, and behaviours and a final written report that provides documentation and accountability. This report may be used for making decisions regarding tenure, transfer, promotion and retention of teachers in accordance with the requirements of The Education Act, 1995.
c)	Professional Learning is as an on-going process designed solely for the development and enhancement of an individual’s impact on student achievement. This process is characterized by an emphasis on self-evaluation, goal-setting, actions, measures of success, constructive feedback and self-directed learning. All these components require an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect.
d)	The Professional Learning Plan is a written document describing a teacher’s intended professional learning over a period of time, usually a school year. This may be developed either in collaboration with colleagues or independently. After a learning plan is written, it is discussed with the principal or designate to clarify the teacher’s inquiry plan for his or her growth. This will help to determine the assistance and support required.
e)	Classroom Walk-throughs – are five to ten-minute visits to a classroom by a supervisor to collect criteria-based evidence.  The criteria are known in advance, and observational data is used to initiate professional conversations. 
f)	Classroom Visits – The supervisor spends a block of time in a classroom observing the beginning, middle, and end of a period of instruction. Visits may be scheduled in advance and include pre and post conferences. 
g)	Unsatisfactory Performance is a term that refers to a teacher who consistently shows deficiency in one or more of the main categories identified on the Rubric for Teacher Effectiveness. When teacher performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory, a Job Improvement Plan may be developed and implemented.
h)	Supervisor is a term used to refer to the principal, vice-principal, or superintendent.
i)	Tenured Teacher is a teacher who has been employed by a Board of Education for two complete school years, four complete and consecutive terms, and during a period with respect to which he or she has received the equivalent of two years’ salary.

4.	Due Process
a)	All teachers have access to due process when addressing concerns relating to teaching expertise. Supervisors and teachers are encouraged to refer to the Good Practices and Dispute Resolution document should any dispute arise during the process. Due process incorporates the following characteristics:
i)	Knowledge of Expectations

viii)	Knowledge of Unsatisfactory Performance
•	Teachers whose performance is unsatisfactory may be placed on a program of intensive assistance as defined by the Job Improvement Plan.

Framework for Supervision
1.	Formative Supervision 
a)	Formative supervision is a process that empowers teachers to assume primary responsibility for their own professional learning and growth related to student learning. Professional development activities customized by the individual teacher effectively meet the needs of both teacher and students. Formative supervision encourages each teacher to reflect on his or her teaching performance, identify areas for professional growth, and develop actions that continue to improve the effectiveness of the teaching/learning process.
b)	Formative supervision poses key questions to every teacher:
i)	What professional learning do I want to achieve to improve student learning/achievement? 
ii)	What professional activities am I going to engage in to achieve this growth? 
iii)	What evidence will I collect to document my learning and support my reflections? 
c)	The teacher and principal or designate will meet to discuss the Professional Learning Plan at least three times during the year:
i)	Initial Meeting:  On or before October 15
ii)	Interim Meeting:  On or before February 15
iii)	Final Meeting:  On or before June 15
d)	The principal or designate will support teachers’ annual Professional Learning Plans through a minimum of three classroom walk-throughs followed by multiple feedback conversations. 
e)	Copies of the Professional Learning Plan will be retained by the teacher and the principal.

2.	Summative Supervision
a)	Purposes 
i)	To assist and determine the competency of teachers who are not tenured; 
ii)	To provide a performance appraisal for teachers who are tenured and are new to an assignment or to a school;
iii)	To provide formal feedback to teachers who are tenured and in the evaluation year of the supervisory cycle (every fifth year); 
iv)	To provide a performance appraisal for teachers who are tenured and who request it;
v)	To ensure a record of teacher learning and provide an opportunity for teachers to engage in deeper conversations with school-based administrators about professional learning and how it enhances student achievement;
vi)	To assist teachers in need of help, and 
vii)	To provide a fair and just system of due process. 
b)	Processes
i)	Non-Tenured Teachers and Reassigned Teachers (to a new school)

a)	A teacher whose performance is unsatisfactory and who has been placed on a Job Improvement Plan will be provided with assistance and the opportunity to raise his or her level of performance to acceptable standards within a reasonable time frame. A team approach will be used to provide such assistance according to the following steps:

STEP 1:  	The nature of the difficulty will be clearly identified and discussed with the teacher in an effort to clarify what changes are expected. Teachers are encouraged to contact the Tri-West president, local counselors and/or the STF provincial organization.

STEP 2: 	The supervisor(s), the principal and the teacher will work collaboratively to develop the targets for the Job Improvement Plan. The plan will be signed by the teacher, principal and supervisor. Each will retain a copy of the plan with one being placed in the teacher’s personnel file. The teacher will have up to four days to seek advice or assistance prior to signing the plan.
STEP 3: 	The plan will be implemented. Progress will be carefully monitored with all efforts to provide assistance. The principal and supervisor(s) will document contacts with the teacher.
STEP 4:	An assessment of the progress will be made at the end of the specified time period.
