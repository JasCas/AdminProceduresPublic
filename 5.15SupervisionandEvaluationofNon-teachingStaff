Background 
Living Sky School Division is dedicated to the continuous professional growth of staff.  Regular supervision is one way to offer ongoing feedback and support to employees.

i)	All employees play important roles in creating healthy, productive learning and working environments.
ii)	Fair and consistent supervision and evaluation practices contribute to positive learning and working environments.
iii)	All employees deserve meaningful feedback on their professional performance and support to grow and improve.
