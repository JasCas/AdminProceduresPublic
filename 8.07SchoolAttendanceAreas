Background

The Board of Education recognizes its authority under the Education Act, 1995 to determine the attendance areas for each school and to assign students to a particular school.
	
The Board of Education encourages parents to enroll their child/children at the school within the attendance area in which they reside.  The belief that students should attend the school in their attendance area is based on the following:
•	A commitment to support our local schools by promoting that all our schools offer high quality educational programming.
•	A commitment to stabilizing and balancing attendance areas, boundaries, and other factors that affect the learning climate.
•	To maintain and achieve program continuity, allocation of staff and transportation costs to enhance community stability.
•	To support families in keeping siblings together.


Procedures

1.	Establishing Attendance Areas

The Board shall consider the following in determining attendance areas:
•	efficiency in bussing and safe walking patterns 
•	capacity of the school and the school site
•	concentration of population and projected student growth and/or decline
•	location and proximity of adjacent schools


2.	Review of School Attendance Boundaries

The Living Sky School Division No. 202 is committed to examining its attendance boundaries on a regular basis and by request to the Board.

Prior to effecting a revision to school attendance areas, parents or guardians will be notified of proposed revision and be provided the opportunity to respond prior to consideration by the Board.  
 

Changes in attendance boundaries will be considered if the request allows time to consider adjustments to class groupings, bus routes and schedules before school commences in the autumn of each year.  The date for receipt of parental applications for a change will be no later than May 1st of any year.

a)	Process

•	The person(s) requesting the change in boundaries within the Living Sky School Division should communicate in writing by May 1st to the Committee of the Board explaining the reason for the requested change.
•	The Committee of the Board will investigate and gather the appropriate information and present it to the Chief Financial Officer.
•	Changes from established boundaries shall be reviewed by the Committee of the Board.  The review may consist of presentations by all interested parties affected by the change.
•	The decision of the Board of Education shall be final and their decision shall be communicated in writing to the applicant requesting the change. 


b)	Considerations regarding Boundary changes:

•	The student’s best interest and welfare will be our main focus
•	Distance to school and time spent in transit
•	Road access or lack of access to residence


In the event that school boundaries are changed, an effort will be made to phase in any changes by allowing the following:

•	Students who are currently attending a school will receive exceptional status allowing the continuation of school attendance to the school in which they attend.  As well, other siblings entering school for the first time will be allowed to attend the same school in order to keep families together. 

•	Students new to the attendance area boundary change will attend the school according to the new attendance boundary.
