2.	The principal is responsible for advising students of the procedures involved when applying for Technology Supported Learning services. 

3.	The principal shall review and screen all applications. For dual credit classes, career testing and post-secondary plans should be taken into consideration.

5.	If the course is not available through the Living Sky Distance and Blended Learning Program and cannot be accommodated synchronously or asynchronously within the Living Sky School Division, the principal shall sign and submit Form 6.11B – LSSD Distance Learning Registration Request and submit it to the Director or designate for approval.
