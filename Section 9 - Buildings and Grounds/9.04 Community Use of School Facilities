Background

Living Sky School Division believes that maximum use of school facilities should occur both in serving the needs of students and other members of the community.

In providing for the community use of schools the Board of Education allows School Community Councils to levy a rental charge to approved groups.  The rental charge is intended to cover operational expenses and additional maintenance costs.  Rentals, for the most part, are limited to service clubs, religious organizations, and other groups seeking to promote the educational, cultural, and recreational aspect of community life.

The Board does not ordinarily sanction renting space to any individual or firm for commercial or monetary gain.  Where a School Community Council wishes to enter into this type of rental arrangement, it must first have the permission of the Chief Financial Officer.  Rental arrangements with Community Colleges, Health Regions, Regional Libraries, Government Agencies and other such stakeholder groups will be negotiated directly with the Chief Financial Officer and will be payable directly to the Living Sky School Division.

Provisions are made to use the schools when requested for conducting local, provincial, or federal elections.
