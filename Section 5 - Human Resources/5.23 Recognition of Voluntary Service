Background  

The Board of Education recognizes that employees who supervise lunch breaks and/or extra-curricular activities do so on a voluntary basis.


Definitions

Noon supervision occurs during the lunch period while no classes are in session.
Extra-curricular activities are those that take place outside the regular hours of instruction.  They involve direct interaction with students and contribute to students’ social, emotional and/or physical development.
