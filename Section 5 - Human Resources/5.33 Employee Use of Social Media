Background
Electronic communication and social media can be effective when used cautiously and professionally.  However, improper use can expose employees to risk when it comes to maintaining professionalism.  
This procedure is designed to provide all employees of Living Sky School Division with guidelines regarding the appropriate use of social media outlets such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, podcasts, etc.  This procedure is in place for the protection of privacy, confidentiality and interests of all employees and Living Sky School Division.  
Employees are ambassadors for the Division and are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and positive manner. Violation of this procedure exposes Living Sky School Division to risks and legal liability and may result in action up to and including termination.
This procedure regarding privacy, confidentiality and non-criticism remains in effect even after employment ends, and legal action may be taken against ex-employees for social media communications that violate this procedure or harm Living Sky School Division.
