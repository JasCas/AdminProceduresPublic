**Background**

The Board of Education values the work of School Community Councils, and
believes that effective communication among the school, the home, and
the community assists in the attainment of Board goals.

**Guidelines**

1.  **Establishment of School Community Councils**

> The Board of Education will establish a School Community Council at
> each school in the school division.
>
> In many schools, committees have been established to support specific
> activities such as graduation or the band program. The School
> Community Council will act in a coordinating role for committees
> operating in support of the Council and the school program.
>
> School Community Councils were established by June 30, 2007.
>
> **Amalgamation School Community Councils**
>
> School Community Councils wishing to amalgamate should make
> application to the Board of Education. The Board of Education may then
> recommend to the Minister of Education that the applicant School
> Community Councils be merged.

2.  **Membership**

> **Representative Members**
>
> Representative Parent and Community Members
>
> The following individuals are eligible to run as Representative Parent
> and/or Community Member:
>
> Parents of students who are enrolled in the school (including parents
> who do not reside within the attendance area of the school); and,
> electors that reside within the school attendance area. These
> provisions specifically do not limit or restrict the election and/or
> participation in voting of parents of students who may be employed by
> the School Division and work in the particular school.
>
> The constitution of each School Community Council outlines the number
> of Representative Parent and Community Members. The number of
> Representative Members ranges from 5 to 9 persons, of which the
> majority must be parents of students attending the school.

Representatives of First Nations

> The constitution of each School Community Council will outline which,
> if any, First Nation representatives are members of the Council. First
> Nations are eligible to have representatives on the Council if there
> are students who live on reserve and attend a school within Living Sky
> School Division. The First Nation will select one representative
> member for a two year term.
>
> **Appointed Members**
>
> The School Principal
>
> A Teacher
>
> The teacher member will be appointed by the principal. The principal
> will work in consultation with staff to determine the teacher member.
>
> Student(s)
>
> One or two students who attend the school, and are enrolled in the
> secondary level will be appointed by the principal.
>
> Other Appointed Members
>
> The constitution of the School Community Council outlines Other
> Appointed Members as suggested by the Council and approved by the
> Board of Education.
>
> **3. Election Procedures**
>
> One-half of the Representative Parent and Community Members of School
> Community Councils will be elected each year. In the first year,
> one-half of the members should be elected for two-year terms with the
> remaining representative members being elected for one-year term to
> establish the staggered terms.
>
> The school principal will name an employee as the local Election
> Supervisor. The Director or designate will act as Election Supervisor
> for the school division. This role involves ensuring a local Election
> Supervisor is selected for each school and the appropriate training
> has been delivered.
>
> Election procedures for Representative Parent and Community Members
> are outlined in the [School Community Council Election Manual]{.ul}.
>
> If, following the nomination process, there are vacant positions on a
> School Community Council, the Board of Education can reduce the number
> of members of that Council. However, if there are fewer than five (5)
> members, the Board of Education can appoint members to fill the vacant
> positions.
>
> For the initial election no special procedures will be used to ensure
> the Representative Parent and Community Members are representative of
> the student population. If following the initial election the Board of
> Education believes that some School Community Councils are not
> representative of the student population, the Board could amend to
> this policy to address such a concern.
>
> **4. Constitution**
>
> An initial constitution has been developed for each School Community
> Council. This Constitution addresses such things as membership,
> officers, Code of Conduct for members of the School Community Council,

> sending suggestions for changes in writing to the Director of
> Education.

> chair of the Council if required to do so by the Board of Education or
