Background 

Every individual (employee, person engaged in internship or field experience program, volunteer, or any other person with direct or sole responsibility for students) is required to report criminal charges as per the procedures below.

Procedures   
All employees of Living Sky School Division, and all persons who have been required to provide criminal record checks, must sign a statement indicating that they have read this procedure and that they understand its provisions.  Form 5.03A will be provided in every employee’s payroll package.  Principals must ensure volunteers and other persons, other than employees of the Division, are aware of this procedure and sign the form.

1.	No later than two working days after an employee, intern, practicum student, or any other person with direct or sole responsibility for students has been charged with an offense, he or she shall verbally, and subsequently in writing, inform the Superintendent of Human Resources or designate of all charges laid.  

2.	Upon receipt of this information, the Superintendent of Human Resources or designate shall immediately inform the Director.

3.	Volunteers shall inform the school principal, who will contact the Superintendent of Human Resources or designate. The principal shall inform the volunteer that his or her services have been withdrawn until the information and written documentation (Form 5.03B) have been assessed.

4.	A submission, by the individual, outlining relevant circumstances may be attached to the written information. 

5.	Upon receipt of the information, the Superintendent of Human Resources or designate shall investigate the circumstances. 
 
6.	Failure to disclose charges, provide a written statement, or submission of inaccurate, false, or misleading statements constitutes grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment in accordance with the provisions of the employee’s contract of employment, or refusal of permission to serve as a volunteer, practicum student or intern.

7.	Subject to the provisions of The Education Act, 1995 and the provisions of the relevant collective agreement, conditions of employment or contract of employment, the Division may, in its discretion, transfer, reassign, or terminate the employment of an employee who has reported or disclosed criminal charges. 

8.	Any action taken is to be conveyed to the individual in writing, a copy of which is to be kept on file. 

9.	Any appeal of the decision is to be made in accordance with the provisions of the employee’s collective agreement, conditions of employment, or where no collective agreement applies, to the Director within 15 working days of notification of the decision. 

10.	If, at the conclusion of all proceedings, a criminal record check confirms no conviction(s) resulting from the incident giving rise to the original charge(s), any documentation that has been placed on file related to the charge(s) for which discipline has not been effected is, at the individual’s request, to be removed and destroyed.

11.	Notwithstanding any of the above, an individual may, at any time, seek legal advice or counsel from his or her employee group or an independent source at his or her expense. 

12.	Should the employee wish, he or she may be accompanied by an individual of choice, barring conflict of interest, or a representative of the employee or the appropriate employee group at any and all meetings that the employee attends regarding the process. Individuals who are not employees may arrange to be accompanied by persons of their choice, barring conflict of interest, at meetings they attend regarding matters pertaining to criminal charges.
