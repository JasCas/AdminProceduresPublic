Background
The Board of Education recognizes the right of all students and employees to learn and work in an environment free from personal, discriminatory or sexual harassment. The Board of Education adheres to the principle of Mutual Respect.  As such, the Board expects staff and students to be respectful and considerate of the feelings of others. No student or employee should be subject to vexatious comments or conduct that is known, or ought reasonably to be known, to be unwelcome or that demeans, belittles or offends his or her dignity. 
The Board, all employees, students and people within school communities have a responsibility to promote, monitor and maintain learning environments and workplaces that are free from harassment.  

Definitions 
Harassment is any inappropriate conduct, comment, display, action or gesture by a person that poses a threat to the health and safety of another person.  
1.	Personal harassment is defined as objectionable conduct or comment, often repeated, that is directed toward a specific person, or persons, and has the effect of creating an intimidating, humiliating, hostile or offensive working or learning environment. Personal harassment does not include conduct or comments made in good faith in the exercise of supervisory rights and responsibilities. 

2.	Discriminatory harassment is defined as harassment based on prohibited grounds as referenced in The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.  
a)	Discriminatory acts against a student include those with respect to the learning environment or any educational program or service provided to the student because of race, creed, religion, colour, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability, physical size or weight, age, nationality, ancestry or place of origin.
b)	Discriminatory acts against a staff member include those with respect to the work environment or any term or condition of employment because of race, creed, religion, colour, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability, physical size or weight, age, nationality, ancestry or place of origin.

3.	Sexual harassment may be verbal, physical or visual.  It may be one incident or a series of incidents. It is always unsolicited and unwelcomed behaviour, and can take several forms including but not limited to jokes with sexual overtones, leering, threats, sexual remarks, sexual advances or invitations, displaying offensive pictures or photographs, physical contact such as patting, touching, pinching or brushing against, and sexual and physical assault.   

Procedures 
1.	Reporting
a)	Any employee or student who has been harassed is advised to immediately tell the harasser to stop.
b)	If an employee knows or suspects a co-worker is the victim of harassment, that employee is encouraged to support the co-worker and advise the co-worker to report the harassment as soon as possible to the appropriate authorities. If a student knows or suspects a fellow student is the victim of harassment, that student is encouraged to support the fellow student and advise the fellow student to report the harassment as soon as possible to a responsible adult such as a teacher, principal and/or parent. 

2.	Informal Complaint
a)	Before proceeding with a formal complaint, an employee who believes he or she has experienced harassment may approach his or her supervisor, federation/union representative or human resource person to discuss the potential means of resolving a complaint and to request assistance in resolving the matter on an informal basis. 
b)	Before proceeding with a formal complaint, a student who believes he or she has experienced harassment or who is unable to confront the harasser shall approach a teacher, counselor, administrator, parent or other trusted adult to obtain advice, support and skills or strategies to halt the harassment. 
c)	The receiver of information should advise the complainant on the contents of this procedure.  If the matter poses a serious threat to the health and safety of the complainant, is criminal in nature, or where circumstances lead the receiver to believe that informal processes such as education and/or mediation cannot prevent the harassment from recurring, the complainant should be encouraged to file a formal complaint.
d)	Students and employees are requested to record pertinent facts which detail alleged incidents. 
e)	The supervisor, or other person to whom the alleged harassment is reported, shall make a written record summarizing the complaint and its resolution.

3.	Formal Complaint and Investigation

i)	Notify the alleged harasser of the complaint, and provide the alleged harasser with information concerning the circumstances of the complaint;
ii)	Request the alleged harasser to respond in writing to the complaint;
iii)	Interview the complainant, the alleged harasser and any other person who may have knowledge of the alleged complaint, and

e)	At any stage of the investigation, the complainant and the alleged harasser may choose to be accompanied by a friend, union representative, association representative or other person of their choice. 
f)	Either party may, after receiving the results of the investigation, make a further submission in writing, and such written submission shall be placed in the file.

h)	The complainant has the right to request the assistance of an Occupational Health Officer to resolve a harassment complaint after first trying to resolve the matter with the employer.

4.	Complaint to Human Rights Commission/Exercise of Legal Rights
a)	The foregoing procedures do not prohibit a person being harassed from making a complaint directly to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission.
b)	This harassment procedure is not intended to discourage the complainant from exercising any other legal rights.

b)	If a loss has been incurred by a complainant, such as a demotion or denial of a promotion, the complainant shall be restored to his or her rightful position.
