Background

Living Sky School Division supports the use of a wide range of instructional and learning resources at varying levels of difficulty, with diversity of appeal, and the presentation of different points of view to meet the curricular needs of students and teachers. 

Selection 
When selecting resources, the following shall be considered:
1.	Materials will enrich and support the curriculum, taking into consideration the varied interests, abilities, learning styles and maturity levels of the students served. 

2.	Materials will stimulate growth in factual knowledge, literary appreciation, aesthetic values and societal standards. 

3.	Materials will present various sides of controversial issues so that young citizens may have an opportunity to develop, under guidance, the practice of critical analysis and to make informed judgments in their daily lives. 

4.	Materials will be representative of the many religious, ethnic and cultural groups and the contributions of such groups to our national heritage and the world community, and should include First Nations and Métis ways of knowing. 

5.	Principle shall be placed above personal opinion and reason above prejudice in the selection of materials of the highest quality, in order to assure a comprehensive collection appropriate to the school community. 


Responsibility for Selection
1.	Responsibility for the selection of materials to be used in a course, program or classroom lies with the professional who will use them, and the principal.

2.	While selection of learning resources involves many people (administrators, teachers, students, community persons, resource centre personnel), the responsibility for coordinating the selection of school learning resources and making the recommendation for purchase rests with the principal. 
 

Criteria for Selection
The following criteria will be used when selecting materials: 
1.	Learning resources shall support and be consistent with the general educational goals of the Ministry of Education and Living Sky School Division and the aims and outcomes of individual schools and specific courses. 

2.	Learning resources shall meet high standards of quality in factual content and presentation. 

3.	Learning resources shall be appropriate for the subject area and for the age, emotional development, ability level, learning styles and social development of the students for whom the materials are selected. 

4.	Learning resources shall have aesthetic, literary and/or social values. 

5.	Physical format and appearance of learning resources shall be suitable for their intended use. 

6.	Learning resources chosen shall be developed by competent authors and producers. 

7.	Learning resources shall be designed to help students gain an awareness of our pluralistic society as well as an understanding of the many important contributions made to our civilization by men or women and minority and ethnic groups, including First Nations and Métis ways of knowing.

8.	Learning resources shall be designed to motivate students and staff to examine their own attitudes and behaviours and to comprehend their own duties, responsibilities, rights and privileges as participating citizens in our society. 

9.	Learning resources shall be selected for their strengths rather than rejected for their weaknesses. 

10.	Biased and slanted learning resources may be provided to meet specific curriculum objectives, for example, to recognize propaganda and its purpose in a given context or to balance an argument. 


Controversial Materials 
The selection of learning resources on controversial issues will be directed towards maintaining a balanced collection representing various views. Learning resources shall clarify historical and contemporary forces by presenting and analyzing intergroup tension and conflict objectively, placing emphasis on recognizing and understanding social and economic problems. 


Canadian Content
Emphasis will be placed on the selection of Saskatchewan or Canadian learning resources where appropriate. These resources include book and non-book learning materials by or about a Canadian person, about a region or event, and/or published or produced in Canada.


Procedure of Selection

2.	Recommendations for purchase involve administrators, teachers, resource centre personnel, students, central office personnel and community persons, as appropriate. 

3.	Gift material shall be judged by the criteria outlined and shall be accepted or rejected by that criteria. 

4.	Selection is an ongoing process which should include the removal of materials no longer appropriate and the replacement of lost and worn materials still of educational value.
