Background
Employees are expected to work the number of hours assigned to them as described in collective agreements or employment contracts.
However, in rare circumstances, a supervisor or principal may request a support staff member to work time in addition to his or her regular hours. This additional time may be banked. Managerial and professional personnel are not eligible to bank time.

Definitions
Time in Lieu: This term refers to hours earned in excess of regular contract hours up to daily and/or weekly overtime thresholds.
Overtime Threshold: Overtime thresholds are defined in the current CUPE 4747 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CUPE support) and the Employment Standards Regulations (out-of-scope support).
Overtime Options
Paid Overtime: This term refers to overtime hours that are paid out upon being earned (not banked). All employees (Central Office and school-based) who choose to be paid for overtime must fill out the Support Staff Banked Time form (described below).
Banked Overtime: This term refers to overtime hours that are earned and credited at the appropriate rate to the employee’s time bank. Central Office employees who choose to bank time must fill out the Support Staff Banked Time form (described below).  School-based employees do not need to complete this form if they are banking time; it is tracked at the school.
Banked Time: Banked time is a combination of time in lieu and banked overtime. Banked time can be taken off with pay during regular work hours at some mutually agreed to later date.
Whether an employee chooses to be paid for overtime hours or to bank the time, he or she will be paid or credited at the appropriate rate.
