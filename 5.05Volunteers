Background 
Living Sky School Division values those persons who volunteer to serve the needs of students. The Division recognizes the support and dedication volunteers bring to school activities and that their efforts can have a very positive impact on students. The Division also recognizes that it has a duty to ensure its students are in the care of persons of exemplary character. 

Procedures  
1.	The principal shall request any volunteer who has direct or sole responsibility for providing supervision of students to submit a current criminal record check, including a vulnerable sector search (5.02 - Criminal Record Checks). Volunteers who provide services under the direct supervision of a Living Sky employee do not require criminal record checks.

2.	The principal shall ensure all volunteers have read procedure 5.03 - Reporting Criminal Charges and obtain from every volunteer a signed copy of Form 5.03A - Statement of Acknowledgement. 

3.	Each volunteer must receive the approval of the principal prior to serving as a volunteer.

4.	No volunteer is to be involved in any one-on-one activity with a student unless he or she has received the prior approval of the principal.

5.	Volunteers are not to have access to student files, academic records or progress reports.

6.	Volunteers are bound by the same code of confidentiality expected of all staff members of the Division. It is inappropriate to discuss students collectively or individually outside the school as a result of information gained as a volunteer.

7.	Volunteers will be considered agents of the Board and under the Division insurance plan while engaged in their volunteer tasks or activities.

8.	In the event that a volunteer may be transporting students, it is the principal’s responsibility to ensure that the volunteer meets the requirements described in Living Sky School Division’s procedures.

9.	Principals shall instruct volunteers to withdraw their services where it is deemed to be in the best interest of the students or the school to do so.

 
10.	The Division supports the Saskatchewan High Schools Athletic Association (SHSAA) in its goal of having staff members coach and supervise all student athletes engaged in extra-curricular activities. The Division also recognizes that, on occasion, schools may need volunteers to serve as community coaches. If this happens, the selection, approval and appointment of community coaches must comply with SHSAA Bylaws and Regulations. These can be found at www.shsaa.ca.

11.	Volunteers shall work under the direct supervision of a teacher or principal unless they have been approved in accordance with the SHSAA Bylaws and Regulations governing the selection, approval and appointment of community coaches.
